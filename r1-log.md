# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [datafiend]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Thursday, January 2, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
I'm starting a total re-do of sacmap.org. It's going be awesome!

### R1D2
I just started the html index and css sheets. Granted, I used some old template, but still I'll count it. Also, OPENSSH wasn't configured.

### R1D3
Added some css to the stylesheet, so no padding on the h1 tag, and no margin on the body.
